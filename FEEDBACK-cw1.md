Remember that every time a method is called (and starts execution), a new level is added to the stack... and when the method finishes, that level in the stack disappears. This was not clear in your diagrams.Also keep in mind that a pointer must point somewhere. For example, on Points 3 and 4 the pointer "card2.travelCardAttached" must point to the same object as "tCard" is pointing to from the stack.
